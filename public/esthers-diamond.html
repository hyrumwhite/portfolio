    <p>
      Esther's <span class="blue--text">diamond</span> went on a walk. And what
      she saw on the walk was a big and fierce cheetah. The cheetah was very
      strong, but no one could break Esther's
      <span class="blue--text">diamond</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diamond was fine after the cheetah. Esther saw a tornado, so she and
      her diamond ran away into a castle.
